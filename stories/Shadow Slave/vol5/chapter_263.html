<p>As Naeve and Sunny made their way across the wall of the port fortress, the battle grew louder behind them. Sounds of screams rose into the night sky, and the battlements beneath them shuddered. Ignoring all of it, they rushed forward.</p><p>As they ran, Naeve yelled: "Have you ever even fought in the water?!" Sunny spared him a tense look, remembering the harrowing journey across the dark sea in the forgotten shore. The boat that Nephis had built from the bones of demons that did not survive till the end... "Once!" The Nightwalker let out a nervous laugh. "How did it go?" Sunny gritted his teeth. "I'm still alive, aren't I?!"</p><p>There was not much of a choice, anyway. Naeve was probably the only ascended from the House of Night inside the fortress — the rest were protecting the battleships sailing across the strait. Bloodwave was going to need all the help he could get. So, Sunny had to join the hunt for the dreadful terror.</p><p>Plus, he wanted to. The abominable creature deserved to die, and especially so by his hand.</p><p>It won't be easy, though...' Sunny had a couple of Memories that would help perform well underwater, but he lacked experience when it came to fighting in the depths of the ocean. Worse than that, Shadow Step and Shadow Manifestation would be nearly useless there — a shadow needed a solid surface to exist, and those were hard to find where he was going.</p><p> Actually, Sunny was unsure how his Aspect would function underwater. Much more distressing was the fact that he did not know much about the Terror of L049, and what the abomination was truly capable of.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>The fact that it relied on mind attacks and manipulation suggested a lack of physical might, but even then, such things were highly relative when it came to a Corrupted creature.</p><p>As Naeve and Sunny made their way across the wall of the port fortress, the battle grew louder behind them.

The Nightwalker was already clad in a light armour that seemed to be made of black seaweed and nacreous shell.</p><p>A pale smile appeared on Naeve's face.</p><p>"Ready?" Sunny stared at the tumultuous dark wave beneath them and shook his head. Then, he jumped.</p><p>The ocean grasped him in it's cold embrace a moment later. Sunny almost panicked, a deluge of unpleasant memories instantly surfaced in his mind, but then discovered that he could breathe normally despite being surrounded by water, That calmed him down a little.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>The Essence Pearl had a strange effect. Sunny could breathe through his nose as if he was standing on solid ground, and there seemed to be an invisible barrier preventing the salty water from flowing up his nostrils. Additionally, the active enchantment of the charm allowed him to see clearly through the dark expanse of the ocean, as if he was wearing a diving mask.</p><p>He was cold, but not terribly so. It seemed that the high element resistance of the Marble Shell, augmented by the shadows, was enough to protect him from freezing to death — adding the Memory of Ice on top of the that turned out to be overkill. Sunny dismissed the blue crystal, relieved to save some Essence.</p><p>'Not_ Not too bad.'</p><p>A moment later, Naeve plunged into the water beside him and swam nimbly forward and down. Sunny had learned how to swim during his Wilderness Survival lessons back at the Academy and practiced it a few times on the Forgotten Shore... And yet, one glance at the Scion of the House of Night made him feel embarrassed.</p><p>The Nightwalker moved through the water with great speed and ease, looking like some kind of graceful aquatic creature. It almost seemed as if he was more comfortable in the water than he had been on land.</p><p>Maybe he was.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>Sighing inwardly, Sunny followed. His movements might not have been as natural or graceful as Naeve's, but with the frightening strength of an Ascended Devil and the help of the Nimble Catch, he found himself more than capable with keeping up.</p><p>They dove deeper into the dark water, soon reaching the ships. Sunny felt a tremendous shadow floating silently, below, a few moments before he saw it... There, in the darkness, a monstrous killer whale was waiting, watching them with its giant blue eyes. .</p>
