<p>Nothing else happened on their way back to the siege capital. It had grown harder to eavesdrop on Morgan and Madoc once again, so Sunny didn't learn much about the consequences of Beastmaster's mocking message. He did, however, understand from small hints and clues that Valor's own ambush had gone slightly better than the one prepared by Song.</p><p> Most of the ambushers even survived, and were now following a different route to return to safe territory. The great clans had basically exchanged slaps. What would come next were actual blows.</p><p>...It was nice to return back to civilization. Sunny slept in a soft bed, had a hot shower, and prepared himself an actual meal. Despite the dire war raging somewhere on the continent - two wars, even - his routine was strangely mundane and peaceful.</p><p>He even received a video message from Rain - the network in East Antarctica was not nearly as in shambles as it had been in the Antarctic Center, so the bandwidth allocated to him allowed for such frivolities from time to time.</p><p>To Sunny's slight disappointment, Rain only spoke about what was happening in her life for a short while, using the rest of the recording to demonstrate the progress she was making in her training and ask for pointers.</p><p>The message ended with a few carefree sentences:</p><p>"Oh... by the way, do you remember the classmate I told you about? The one whose sister is an MWP pilot in Antarctica. Apparently, her unit got into a really bad situation, and she only survived because a Master named Devil saved her. Thank the gods... I can't even imagine how her family would have felt if not for him. Anyway, if you know that guy, buy him a drink. Better yet, try to stay close to him. He is apparently some sort of a big hero, so you'll be safer with him. Uh... what I am trying to say is that you should be careful. Take care of yourself. Bye!"</p><p>The message ended, leaving Sunny in amused silence. He shook his head.</p><p>'What are the chances... and what the hell does she mean, do I know that guy? Have I not told her that people call me the Devil of Antarctica? I'm sure I bragged about it...'</p><p>Then, he went about composing a response, first going over her technique and swordsmanship, then adding a few phrases at the end:</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>"Yes, I do remember. As for the Devil... as it happens, I know him pretty well. That guy is indeed amazing. He is also very powerful, handsome, and disgustingly rich. Your classmate's sister was really very fortunate to meet him. He mostly keeps company with Saints and beautiful Legacies from the Great Clans these days, but since you asked, I'll go buy him a drink right after finishing writing this message..."</p><p>Sunny grinned as he finished and sent the message, then fulfilled his promise by walking to the nearest provisions stall and ordering a cup of cheap synthetic coffee.</p><p>He savored its warmth on the street, watching the refugees sheltered within the city walls go about their daily lives. The atmosphere in the siege capital was not at all light - in fact, it was charged by distress and dread - but it was not at all as heavy as it had been in Falcon Scott.</p><p>No matter how full of tribulations and anxiety their lives had become, people actually lived here, not just tried desperately to survive. Sunny felt that he was alive, too.</p><p>Rain was safe and not showing any symptoms of the Spell. The evacuation was proceeding at a healthy pace. Nephis, Cassie, Effie, Kai, and Jet were all doing fine. As for the great clans...</p><p>He now had a clear target in mind, at least. The assassins of the Song clan were going to arrive soon. Preventing the clash between them and the forces of Valor from spilling into these streets would be his first independent move. He had to prepare well.</p><p>Sunny finished his coffee, then took a walk toward the headquarters of the Valor clan. His duties as a government envoy could not wait... there were issues he had to pass along, reports he had to make, and secrets he had to steal.</p><p>Before he could do any of it, though, Cassie stopped by the small office Sunny had been given within the compound to fetch him on behalf of Morgan. The Princess of War wanted to see him first thing in the morning, for some reason.</p><p>As they walked through the corridors of the lavish compound, Sunny glanced at the blind girl and asked:</p><p>"What exactly does she want this time?"</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>Cassie hesitated for a few moments, then shrugged.</p><p>"I'm not sure. She seemed excited about something... well, as far as Morgan allows herself to show genuine emotions, at least."</p><p>Sunny sighed. After a short span of silence, he asked another question:</p><p>"Hey, can you help me out with something in the near future?"</p><p>The blind girl slowed down a little.</p><p>"With what?"</p><p>He considered his words for a few moments.</p><p>"I want to visit a few places on the Chained Isles. The flying ship Noctis left behind can now descend through the Crushing, right? It will only take a couple days, if you pilot it."</p><p>Cassie smiled.</p><p>"Oh! Sure, I can help. The Ivory Tower has drifted east of the Tear, though, so the journey might take a bit more time."</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>Sunny had a few reasons to return to the Chained Isles... but the main one was on the Shipwreck Island, where he had fought the Wormvine.</p><p>Or rather, under it.</p><p>The remains of Sun Prince still swayed there, tangled in the broken chains. Sunny wanted the Imp to devour as much of the steel giant as possible... his initial desire to make the little fiend develop a nearly indestructible body was a lofty one, but in practice, finding enough magical metal to feed the ravenous Shadow was proving to be a problem.</p><p>So, it was very convenient to know the location of a giant, dead, ancient iron Saint.</p><p>As he was imagining how much the Imp would improve after sinking his teeth into the Sun Prince, Cassie led him to a guarded door and opened it. Sunny was a little surprised, since it was not one of the usual places where he met the emissaries of Valor.</p><p>In fact, it was a spacious, heavily reinforced dojo with all kinds of swords and implements of war resting in armored cases.</p><p>Morgan was standing in the middle of the dojo, wearing nothing except for a light black tunic. Her vermilion eyes were gleaming with sharp, intense desire.</p><p>Desire to cross swords with a worthy opponent, and destroy them.</p><p>Sunny froze.</p><p>'I... ah... I suddenly don't feel safe...'</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>The princess of clan Valor smiled widely at the sight of him.</p><p>"Master Sunless. If I remember correctly, you promised me a spar?"</p>
